## PowerBI Project

The idea of the repository is to share some projects using PowerBI as data vizualization tool. 
Each folder represents a different dashbord using open source data such as Kaggle Datasets and so on. 

I wish to thanks University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to provide the course [Tools for Exploratory Data Analysis in Business](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tools-exploratory-data-analysis-business?#instructors) where I could learn how to run PowerBI such as other Data Analysis tool like R and mostly my mind!
